# Overview

## Description

### Shape Calculator
This application is for finding the **Area and Perimeter of 2D Shapes** .The programming language used in this application is java.
In this application user can select from the given shapes and by providing the required measurements user can find the area and perimeter.

Here user will be asked to select a shape and user will be asked to give the appropriate measurement for the shape.
Based on the given input user can calculate the area and perimeter.

If there is any error in the calculation then the user will let the error message through a Toast/alert message in android.
For this I have used the error handling method in Java **(try and catch)**.

## Purpose:

By developing this application, the main goal was to get to know more about the **Android Development** and to learn more about **layouts and activities .**
